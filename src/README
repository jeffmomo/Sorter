Usage:

xsort [-k <runsize>] [-r <maxfiles>] [-d <tempdir>] [-o|-gzo <outputname>] [inputname]

The -gzo option enables gzipping during the creating and filling of runs. The final output has to be decompressed, resulting in 1 additional run.
However, due to the significantly smaller file sizes, the overall number of IO operations is lower.

The output of xsort will be either located in the current directory, or, if tempdir is specified, tempdir.
