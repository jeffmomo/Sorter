Usage:

xsort [-k <runsize>] [-r <maxfiles>] [-d <tempdir>] [-o|-gzo <outputname>] [inputname]

The -gzo option enables gzipping during the creating and filling of runs. The final output has to be decompressed, resulting in 1 additional run.
However, due to the significantly smaller file sizes, the overall number of IO operations is lower.
